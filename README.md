### Hello there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ˜€ Fun fact: I've decided to become a software engineer right after I've played Age of Empires (back in 1997) on mom's working PC. It was the very first game I've ever played on PC. Haven't become a Game Developer, but still - writing code ðŸ’»

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on some micro-services for my personal project - [Template Tasks](https://templatetasks.com). Will share them once they'll be ready to clone and use ðŸ˜œ

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Kotlin and diving deeper into Python 3
