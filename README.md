### Hello there 👋

- 😀 Fun fact: I've decided to become a software engineer right after I've played Age of Empires (back in 1997) on my mom's work PC.
It was the very first game I've ever played on PC.
Haven't become a Game Developer though, but still - writing code 💻

- 🔭 Currently working on some libraries and micro-services for my personal project [Template Tasks](https://github.com/TemplateTasks).

- 🌱 Learning Kotlin, diving deeper into Python 3 🐍
